A data analysis and case study created by Kuroji Fusky that collects
and parses drawing data from a furry artist and illustrator [Paco Panda][paco].

## How it works

The main gist of the project is that it uses a web scraper written in Python to get new
drawing submission from his socials; then cleans up the data and adds it to the
database. And using that to build this website and the underlying APIs on it!

It uses a combination of [BeautifulSoup4](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Soup_(HTML_parser)>)
and [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/) to scrap drawing data from Paco's
socials and adds it to a Redis database that pushes the image binary and the JSON data
along with it.

Once we got the scraped data, it uses FastAPI to provide a REST API and does the data science
stuff on the fly.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher (LTS recommended)
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Yarn
- Docker

### Installation

Install the packages from both directories

```sh
# Install client website

# Go to server
cd src/python

# Setup venv
python -m venv venv

# Linux
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Then install the goodies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**[Optional]** This project uses both [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com), `pre-commit` needs to be installed first.

```sh
pip install pre-commit
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the public APIs only accept `GET` requests. Any
> other request method will respond with `405 Method Not Allowed`
> or `403 Forbidden`.
>
> `ðŸ‘‘` - only allowed to be pushed with an auth token

### Endpoints

- `GET /stats{?filters}`
- `GET /artworks`
- `GET /artwork{/title}`
- `GET /characters`
- `GET /character{?names}`
- `POST /new/character/` ðŸ‘‘
- `POST /new/artwork/` ðŸ‘‘

## About this project

The project began on October 31st 2021. The possible inspiration from this
project is through McBroken (basically a McDonald's broken ice cream machine
site) and it'd be interesting to see in all of his drawings to see said data,
and its various datasets.

This project collects the following:

- The title and date of the piece
- Number of character(s) appearances, including species and names
- Media type (either drawn digital or traditional)
- Programs/mediums used (i.e. Photoshop, Procreate, etc.)
- The source where I got the data (i.e. FurAffinity, DeviantArt, InkBunny,
  Weasyl, etc.)
