# Project Description

**Paco Panda Drawing Stats** is an open source data visualization project
that collects all 1.8K+ drawings from a furry artist and illustrator
[pandapaco](https://twitter.com/panda_paco), written in TypeScript and Python.

## History

This project began on October 31, 2021, and the possible inspiration from this
project is through McBroken (basically a McDonald's broken ice cream machine
site) and it'd be interesting to see in all of his drawings to see said data
and it's various datasets.

## Gathering data

It collects:

- Name and date of the artwork
- Species and character names
- Number of character in each artwork
- Type (previously Medium) (either drawn digitally or traditional with
  exceptions of programs and tools used)
- Medium (for tools/programs used in an artwork)
- Source (either from FurAffinity or DeviantArt)

Previously, I manually copy-pasted data from the sheets and would turn them
into a JSON from the web app to be parsed. It took me a while to use a
scraping method with BeautifulSoup library.

So, I made BeautifulSoup target Paco's gallery page on FurAffinity and get the title,
description, date, and tags, then save them in a Redis database.

From the compiled 2021 Google Sheet data, here's the data I've compiled:

## But, why?

It's really not my intention to impress him in general, I'm just a huge fan of
his artwork and his unique and adorable art style that I'd want to see how many
characters he's drawn since early to mid 2000s but he'd for sure find it
interesting as it's more of a fun project to a new hobby of mine, learning not
only JavaScript, but also learning a bit of back-end and basic data management
in the process of other projects I do.

Well, sure - it may feel like I watch him on every step, but I only
use them for analytical and informational purposes for this project; parsing
drawing data on his Twitter profile would be difficult and will require more
work.
